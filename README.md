It works for my mum , but there are bugs.

android tablet  对主
====================
The project is a playcard game which was popular in aged guys. My mum is one of them. She only likes the game. However, no software for the game at all. I have to learn android and develope the game as a project for her. 
Now, my job is working in my mum's hands by a tablet. She is very happy to play with the AI opponent which I create for her.

The rule of the game is very simple but interested, and like bridge card rule. The goal of every round is get enough score and try to be bigger than opponent at last hand. Upgrading is from 3 to Ace. Who get Ace at first is the winner of one game.
Bugs are unavoidable. It is appreciated that someone can point out them!

对主游戏，是一个中国东北，特别是黑龙江省多人玩的扑克游戏。我的高堂只愿意玩这一种，但找不到电玩，故不得不自学自编，此程序简化成双人玩。程序已经能玩，但还有bug,主要是有时会异常退出。
